[Full documentation here](/docs/readme.md)

## Roadmap

1. **Add Type and Example in Swagger APIProperty() Decorator**

   - Update the Swagger `APIProperty()` decorator to include type and example properties for better API documentation.

2. **Integrate with Real-World Open Source Third-Party APIs**

   - Build a solid architecture for interacting with third-party APIs to ensure seamless and reliable integrations.

3. **Implement the Remaining [RealWorld API Specifications](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/)**

   - [Follow User](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/#follow-user)
   - [Unfollow User](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/#unfollow-user)
   - [Feed Articles](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/#feed-articles)
   - [Favorite Article](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/#favorite-article)
   - [Unfavorite Article](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/#unfavorite-article)

4. **Add Clap Feature for Articles**
   - **Database**: Add a `clap` table with the following columns: `id`, `article_id` (foreign key), `user_id` (foreign key), and `counter`, with a composite primary key on `article_id` and `user_id`.
   - **API to Clap an Article**: Create an API endpoint that allows users to clap for an article. Each clap will increment the counter associated with the user and article.
   - **Get Articles API Update**: Modify the existing "get articles" API to include the total clap count for each article, aggregating claps from all users.

5. **Add Unit Testing and E2E Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive unit and e2e tests to ensure code quality and functionality. Leverage Hygen templates to automate the creation of test files where possible, streamlining the testing process.
